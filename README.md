- 👋 Hi, I’m @jloser - Jochen Loser

- 👀 I’m interested in programming in Python, Data Science, Statistics, ... well, I guess I am not the only one.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html). I am using it to simulate a ticketing environment with customers and support advisors in order to find out the number of needed advisors based on an incoming ticket rate.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well, whatever is interesting. Don't have too much time at hands. But I try to program in every free minute.
- 📫 You can reach me in GitHub @jloser
